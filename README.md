## What is Sassdash?

Developed with Sass toolkit developer in mind, Sassdash gives you nearly the full expressive power of lodash for JavaScript, inside your SCSS projects. Sassdash is a collection of utility functions, just like lodash. Sassdash never outputs any CSS declarations as it provides no mixins to do so.

## Installation

```bash
ember install ember-cli-sassdash
```

This addon will automatically install [ember-cli-sass](https://github.com/aexmachina/ember-cli-sass) as a dependency and create an `app.scss` file in your application at `styles/app.scss` with the following import statement at the top of the file:

```sass
@import "sassdash";
```

Both the previously mentioned `@import` as well as the `ember-cli-sass` addon are required.

## Usage

This step is handled in the default blueprint, but make sure in your `app.scss` to simply add the following at the top of the file (if it isn't already included):

```sass
@import "sassdash";
```
